- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on physics simulation developers.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with who can beautify my node editor.
- 🎓 I'm a college student major in software engineering :)
- 💬 Ask me about computer graphics and operating system.
- 📫 How to reach me: 1931127624@qq.com or archibate@foxmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: he, she, you, me, I, we, us, this, them, that.
